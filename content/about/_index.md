After more than 10 years of corporate life in banking and wealth management, I have decided to pursue a digital side of the real world.

Digital opens a brand new horizon which joins up visual content with your daily life. Although I prefer travelling, tangible exploration of world instead of visual orgasm with your social media, I am more happy to apply my skill developed in Le Wagon Shanghai, to help individuals to visualize their mind, thoughts and information to others through the web.

#### Education

* Electronic Engineering + Business Management in HK University of Science and Technology
* Statistics in HKU

Technology does improve our lives, but down to one true rule, keep it simple and equal. Preferably it would help to fight Global Warming.
